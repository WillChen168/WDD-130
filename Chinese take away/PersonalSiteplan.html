      <h3>Best dishes</h3>
      <p>
        In our menu there are few dishes the customer like the most 
        THE ORIGINAL ORANGE CHICKEN
        Sichuan Province The Original Orange ChickenÂ® is inspired by a well-known appetizer called chenpi
        niurou (tangerine peel beef), in which slices of boneless beef are marinated
        deep-fried and then wok-cooked with dried chillies, Snihuan pepper and
        tangerine peel. We've substituted chicken for beef, and introduced an element of
        sweet and sour alongside the citrus and chili notes.

        TERIYAKI CHICKEN
        In Hong Kong cooking, you'll find pork chops and large pieces of chicken due to
        the territory's long history of contact with European food cultures. Often times,
        meat is served over rice with a sauce either drizzled on top or on the side. Our
        Grilled Teriyaki Chicken is inspired by the East-Meets-West Hong Kong-style
        chicken steak, we've paired it with its own Japanese teriyaki sauce.
